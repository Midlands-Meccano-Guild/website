  <h1>Midlands Meccano Guild Website</h1>
  <p>See https://midlands-meccano-guild.github.io/website/mmg.ssofb.co.uk/HomePage.html</p>
  <p>This is a static copy of the site at http://mmg.ssofb.co.uk/</p>
  <p>The site was created using PmWIki, which is harder to host, so a static backup was taken and placed here as a fallback.</p>
